      Sir Winston Leonard Spencer Churchill (30 November 1874 – 24 January 1965) 
      was a British statesman, soldier, and writer who served as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom twice,
      from 1940 to 1945 during the Second World War, and again from 1951 to 1955. Apart from two years between 1922 and 1924, 
      he was a Member of Parliament (MP) from 1900 to 1964 and represented a total of five constituencies.
      Ideologically an economic liberal and imperialist, he was for most of his career a member of the Conservative Party,
      which he led from 1940 to 1955. He was a member of the Liberal Party from 1904 to 1924.

    <ul>
      <li>Web1: At this generation the websites were only basicly implemented HTML code and were read-only. In order to access them it was needed to have the exact and accurate URL to the website. Graphical elements were very basic. Websites were static and there were alot of personal web pages.</li>
      <li>Web2: At the second generation the websites were no longer read-only and the users could write into it where needed. Website design could offer connectivity between the website's users and could actively react to the user's input. APIs were created, and information could flow between the users and the website actively during usage. </li>
      <li>Web3: The Third generation included the ability to execute code aswell. Websites are more advanced and immersive. The graphical and technical possibiles in Web3 gave place to increasingly complicated website designs and functionality additions. Web3 gave rise to blockchainm decentralized protocols and AI implementations on the web.</li>

      <li>Web1: Search result would be a very basic HTML page with text information about Churchill's life and accomplishments. results are minimal.</li>
      <li>Web3: Search results would be much more expansive and relevent, ranging from raw textual information to images and videos related to Churchill's life. Additional results might lead to other politicians who were similiar to Churchill.</li>
